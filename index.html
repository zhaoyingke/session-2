    <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
    <p>
        <div>I'm glad I never lived next to the water </br> So I could never get used to the beach </br> And I'm glad I never grew up on a mountain </br> To figure out how high the world could reach</div></br>

        <div>I love the miles between me and the city </br> Where I quietly imagine every street </br> And I'm glad I'm only picturing the moment </br> I'm glad she never fell in love with me</div></br>

        <div>For some the world?s a treasure to discover </br> And your scenery should never stay the same </br> And they're trading in their dreams for explanations </br> All in an attempt to entertain</div></br>

        <div>But I love the miles between me and the city </br> Where I quietly imagine every street </br> And I'm glad I'm only picturing the moment </br> I'm glad she never fell in love with me</div></br>

        <div>The trick of love is to never let it find you </br> It's easy to get over missing out </br> I know the 'how's' and 'when's' </br> But now and then she's all I think about</div></br>

        <div>I wonder how it feels to be famous </br> But wonder is as far as I will go </br> 'Cause I?d probably lose myself in all the pictures </br> And end up being someone I don't know</div> </br> 

        <div>So it's probably best I stay in Indiana </br> Just dreaming of the world as it should be </br> Where every day is a battle to convince myself </br> I'm glad she never fell in love with me</div> </br>
